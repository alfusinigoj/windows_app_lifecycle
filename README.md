windows app lifecycle 
=====================

The windows application lifecycle implements the traditional Cloud Foundry deployment
strategy.

The **Builder** downloads buildpacks and app bits, and produces a droplet.

The **Launcher** runs the start command using a standard rootfs and
environment.

The **WebAppServer** runs a HostableWebCore server to host the user's app.
